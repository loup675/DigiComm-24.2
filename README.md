UFC - 2024.2

Was really (REALLY) helped by the following book on the computational problems:

Digital Modulations using Python - Mathuranathan Viswanathan (2019)

Also few other stuff that helped me:

https://pysdr.org/content/digital_modulation.html#python-example;

https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/gray-code.html;

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/127704/algorithm-to-return-all-combinations-of-k-elements-from-n?page=1&tab=votes#tab-top;

Digital Communications 5th edition - John G. Proakis, Masoud Salehi;

And a bunch of stackoverflow answers to every dumb question I had to ask myself when trying to program something I had no idea how to in Python.;

Also keep in mind that I had some attempts/iterations more hand-made on making some things in the computational problems, such as creating the QAM constellations and such, but those have been deprecated long ago in the project, so I'll just keep the final answers here. Might add a deprecated.py later to keep an archive of my attempted solutions.
